## Current State

### Closed

- Runtime is split into `bot`, `worker`, `watcher`, `admin web`, `player portal`, and `console-agent`
- This workstation has already cut over the runtime database to PostgreSQL
- Prisma tooling is provider-aware and test-safe
- Runtime env parsing has a dedicated boundary under `src/config/`
- Bot and worker startup wiring has been moved into `src/bootstrap/`
- Bot ready/runtime boot logic and community listeners have been extracted from the main entry file
- Bot interactions and ops-alert routing have been extracted from the main entry file
- Admin auth includes DB login, Discord SSO, TOTP 2FA, step-up auth, session revoke, and security event logging
- Admin route groups are partly split under `src/admin/api/` and `src/admin/audit/`
- Admin page/static loading, request/body parsing, request routing, access/security/control-panel helpers, live/SSE/metrics helpers, security export helpers, and Discord OAuth client calls are split out of the main server entry file
- Player API groups are partly split under `apps/web-portal-standalone/api/`
- Player portal page routing, canonical redirects, env/body/player helper assembly, response/security helpers, and canonical runtime helpers now have dedicated runtime modules
- Player portal page/static loading, reward/wheel helpers, and HTTP lifecycle wiring now have dedicated runtime modules
- Production validation commands exist and CI artifacts are written on every verification run
- Validation scripts now share one machine-readable runtime status contract via `--json`
- `ci:verify` now emits a contract-driven `artifacts/ci/verification-contract.json`
- `lint` now includes syntax, encoding, ESLint, and docs/metadata formatting checks
- Policy checks now cover runtime profile parsing, control-panel env registry rules, smoke behavior, readiness ordering, and module docs
- Tenant scope exists across core platform, commerce, and audit surfaces
- Tenant DB topology resolver/provisioning now exists for `schema-per-tenant` and `database-per-tenant`
- Tenant-scoped platform, tenant-config, purchase/admin-commerce, delivery persistence, player/account-wallet paths, and community/admin stores now resolve Prisma datasource targets through the selected tenant DB topology where tenant context is present
- This workstation has live `console-agent` proof: preflight passes against a real `SCUM` window and a live command reached the game log
- This workstation has live watcher proof: watcher reports `ready` against a real `SCUM.log` path and exposes recent parsed `admin-command` events
- Delivery verification now has a first-party native-proof backend that reads `SCUM.db`
- This workstation has live native delivery proof from game state for `Water_05l`, `Weapon_M1911`, `Magazine_M1911`, and `Weapon_AK47`
- First-party native-proof scripts now exist at `scripts/delivery-native-proof-scum-savefile.js` and `scripts/delivery-native-proof-template.ps1`
- Admin browser shell/common helpers are extracted under `src/admin/assets/dashboard-shell.js`
- Admin snapshot/session/form browser runtime is extracted under `src/admin/assets/dashboard-runtime.js`
- Admin browser DOM refs, mutable state, and event binding/startup wiring are extracted under `src/admin/assets/dashboard-dom.js`, `src/admin/assets/dashboard-state.js`, and `src/admin/assets/dashboard-bindings.js`
- Admin server lifecycle/bootstrap wiring is extracted under `src/admin/runtime/adminServerLifecycleRuntime.js`
- Player portal helper/auth/route bootstrap wiring is extracted under `apps/web-portal-standalone/runtime/portalBootstrapRuntime.js`

### Partial

- Admin web still does not expose every env/config switch
- Tenant isolation now runs in PostgreSQL RLS strict mode for the current tenant-scoped platform, tenant-config, purchase/admin-commerce, delivery persistence, player/account-wallet paths, and community/admin store surface, and tenant-aware service paths now honor the configured schema/database topology when enabled
- Restore remains a controlled maintenance workflow with confirmation gates
- Exported diagrams, authenticated admin/player dashboard captures, and a simple demo GIF now exist under `docs/assets/`, but broader in-game evidence still depends on live runtime capture

### Runtime-dependent

- `agent` execution still depends on Windows session state and a real SCUM client window
- Watcher readiness depends on an actual `SCUM.log` path
- Some live SCUM command behavior remains server-dependent

## Current Workstation Notes

- Database provider in `.env`: `postgresql`
- Runtime database endpoint: `127.0.0.1:55432`
- `TENANT_DB_ISOLATION_MODE=postgres-rls-strict`
- `TENANT_DB_TOPOLOGY_MODE=shared`
- Admin origin: `https://admin.genz.noah-dns.online/admin`
- Player origin: `https://player.genz.noah-dns.online`
- `DELIVERY_EXECUTION_MODE` in `.env`: `agent`
- `DELIVERY_NATIVE_PROOF_MODE` in `.env`: `required`
- `SCUM_WATCHER_ENABLED=true`
- `SCUM_LOG_PATH` in `.env`: `Z:\SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\SCUM Server\SCUM\Saved\Logs\SCUM.log`
- `SCUM_CONSOLE_AGENT_REQUIRED=false`

These are machine-specific notes. Keep them aligned with the active env when this workstation changes.

## Validation Notes

Current validation stack:

- `npm run lint`
- `npm run test:policy`
- `npm test`
- `npm run doctor`
- `npm run security:check`
- `npm run readiness:prod`
- `npm run smoke:postdeploy`

Important detail:

- `readiness:prod` now includes `smoke:postdeploy`
- `smoke:postdeploy` no longer treats required runtimes as healthy based only on HTTP 200 and `{ ok: true }`
- optional runtimes such as a disabled watcher or an optional console-agent are reported without failing the run
- the latest local full pass on this workstation completed on `2026-03-17`

## Remaining Non-Delivery Gaps

Use [docs/WORKLIST.md](./docs/WORKLIST.md) as the only detailed backlog.

Short form:

- expand tenant DB topology rollout beyond the current platform/commerce/delivery surface if the target architecture is `schema-per-tenant` or `database-per-tenant`
- expand native delivery proof coverage beyond the current live workstation matrix and server configuration

## Review Warnings

- Do not claim full tenant isolation; PostgreSQL RLS foundation exists for part of the tenant-scoped surface, but full DB-level isolation is not complete
- Do not claim every setting is editable from admin web
- Do not claim agent execution is independent of Windows and SCUM client state
- Do not claim full application-wide DB-level tenant isolation
- Do not claim native proof coverage for every delivery type or every server environment yet
- Do not use hardcoded test counts in documents; use CI artifacts instead

## Summary

The repository is in reviewable shape: PostgreSQL runtime is in place, validation commands are wired, the main admin/player/runtime surfaces exist, and the main documentation set now points back to evidence. The remaining work is mostly boundary hardening and coverage, not missing core infrastructure.
