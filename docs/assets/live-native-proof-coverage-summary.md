# Native Proof Environment Coverage

Generated: `2026-03-17T06:00:05.440Z`

## Current Verified Environment

- id: `workstation-local-agent-2026-03-17`
- label: Current workstation / local dedicated server
- workstation: Windows workstation with live SCUM client window
- server profile: Current local dedicated server configuration on this machine
- execution mode: `agent`
- tenant topology mode: `shared`
- proof sources: SCUM.db, SCUM.log
- notes: This is evidence for the current workstation only. It is not evidence of environment-independent native proof.

## Delivery Class Coverage

| Delivery class            | Proved on current environment | Strategy          | Cases                                             |

| medical                   | yes                           | world-spawn-delta | medical-bandage                                   |
| teleport wrapper profiles | yes                           | world-spawn-delta | teleport-wrapper-m1911, announce-teleport-bandage |

## Wrapper Profile Coverage

| Label                     | Delivery profile        | Proved | Strategy          |
| ------------------------- | ----------------------- | ------ | ----------------- |
| announce-teleport-bandage | announce_teleport_spawn | yes    | world-spawn-delta |
| teleport-wrapper-m1911    | teleport_spawn          | yes    | world-spawn-delta |

## Experimental Cases

- `ammo-762` (ammo): Repeated 2026-03-17 live attempts timed out without a confirmed SCUM.db delta. Representative ammo proof now passes on this workstation with Cal_7_62x39mm_Ammobox, but loose-round IDs Ammo_762 and Cal_7_62x39mm still remain unproved here.

## Remaining Environment Coverage

- Additional SCUM server configuration: Capture the representative native-proof matrix on a server with a different SCUM patch/config/runtime profile.; Needed before claiming broader environment coverage across server configurations.
- Additional workstation/runtime: Capture the representative native-proof matrix on another workstation or Windows session/runtime.; Needed before claiming native proof is reproduced beyond this workstation.
