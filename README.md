SCUM TH Platform is a control plane for a SCUM community stack built around:

- a Discord bot
- an admin web UI
- a player portal
- a worker runtime
- a watcher runtime
- an optional console-agent

If a statement in this repository is not backed by code, tests, CI artifacts, or runtime logs, treat it as supporting context rather than evidence.

## What Works Now

### Runtime and topology

- Split processes for `bot`, `worker`, `watcher`, `admin web`, `player portal`, and `console-agent`
- Health endpoints for each runtime
- Topology checks, production checks, smoke checks, and PM2 manifests
- Split origin deployment for admin and player surfaces
- Runtime env parsing now has a dedicated boundary under `src/config/`
- Bot and worker startup wiring now lives under `src/bootstrap/`
- Bot ready/runtime boot logic and community listeners are split under `src/bootstrap/`
- Admin route groups are partly split under `src/admin/api/` and `src/admin/audit/`
- Admin page/static loading, request/body parsing, request routing, access/security/control-panel helpers, live/SSE/metrics helpers, and Discord OAuth client calls are split under `src/admin/runtime/` and `src/admin/auth/`
- Player API groups are partly split under `apps/web-portal-standalone/api/`
- Player portal page routing and canonical redirects now live under `apps/web-portal-standalone/runtime/portalPageRoutes.js`
- Player portal page/static loading, response/security helpers, reward/wheel helpers, and HTTP lifecycle wiring now live under `apps/web-portal-standalone/runtime/`

### Persistence

- PostgreSQL is supported as the active runtime database provider
- Prisma generation and migration commands are provider-aware
- SQLite-to-PostgreSQL cutover tooling exists in-repo
- Tests run against isolated provider-specific databases or schemas instead of the live runtime database
- Tenant DB topology resolver and provisioning script now exist for `shared`, `schema-per-tenant`, and `database-per-tenant`
- Tenant-scoped platform, tenant-config, purchase/shop, delivery persistence, player wallet/account, cart/redeem/rent/wheel, and community/admin store paths now resolve Prisma datasource targets through the selected tenant DB topology where tenant context is available

### Admin and player surfaces

- Admin login from database credentials
- Discord SSO for admin
- TOTP 2FA and step-up auth for sensitive routes
- Session revoke, security events, request trail, audit, and restore preview
- Player portal with wallet, purchase history, redeem, profile, and Steam link flows
- Control panel for a growing subset of runtime and bot settings
- Control panel env metadata now classifies keys by policy and apply mode
- Bot and worker entrypoints are now mostly bootstrap/runtime composition
- Admin browser shell/common helpers now live under `src/admin/assets/dashboard-shell.js`
- Admin snapshot/session/form runtime helpers now live under `src/admin/assets/dashboard-runtime.js`
- Admin browser DOM refs, mutable state, and event binding/startup wiring now live under `src/admin/assets/dashboard-dom.js`, `src/admin/assets/dashboard-state.js`, and `src/admin/assets/dashboard-bindings.js`
- Admin server lifecycle/bootstrap wiring now lives under `src/admin/runtime/adminServerLifecycleRuntime.js`
- Player portal helper/auth/route bootstrap wiring now lives under `apps/web-portal-standalone/runtime/portalBootstrapRuntime.js`

### Operations and observability

- Runtime supervisor with per-role status
- Notification center and reconcile findings in admin
- Backup / restore preview and restore guardrails
- CI artifacts for lint, tests, doctor, security checks, readiness, and smoke
- `doctor`, `security:check`, `readiness`, `smoke`, and `doctor:topology` now share one machine-readable report contract when called with `--json`
- `ci:verify` now writes `verification-contract.json` from the shared JSON contract instead of relying only on raw log parsing
- `lint` now covers syntax, text-encoding scan, ESLint, and formatting checks for repo metadata/docs
- Policy checks now include runtime profile, control-panel config registry, smoke behavior, readiness sequencing, and module docs
- Live runtime proof now exists on this workstation for `console-agent` preflight/execute and watcher `ready` state against a real `SCUM.log`
- Watcher health now exposes recent parsed `admin-command` events from the live server log
- Delivery verification now supports a first-party native-proof backend that reads live SCUM save state from `SCUM.db`
- Native proof now supports both inventory delta and world-spawn delta verification on this workstation
- First-party native-proof scripts now exist at `scripts/delivery-native-proof-scum-savefile.js` and `scripts/delivery-native-proof-template.ps1`

## What Is Partial

- Admin web still does not cover every `.env` or config setting
- Multi-tenant isolation now runs in PostgreSQL RLS strict mode for the current tenant-scoped platform, tenant-config, purchase/admin-commerce, and delivery persistence surface, and tenant-aware service paths now route through the selected schema/database-per-tenant topology when configured
- Restore still relies on a guarded maintenance flow rather than fully automatic rollback
- Real captures now exist for admin login, authenticated admin dashboard, player landing, player login, authenticated player dashboard, player showcase, and a simple demo GIF under `docs/assets/`
- `src/adminWebServer.js` and `apps/web-portal-standalone/server.js` are now thin bootstrap/composition entrypoints
- `src/admin/dashboard.html` is now a thinner shell, and the browser runtime is split across focused assets under `src/admin/assets/`, though the surface is still large

## What Is Runtime-Dependent

- `agent` delivery execution depends on a live Windows session and a working SCUM client window
- Watcher health depends on a real `SCUM.log` path being present and staying readable
- Some SCUM command behavior still depends on the target server configuration and game patch level

## Known Limitations

- SQLite remains in dev/import/compatibility paths, but it is no longer the target runtime path for this workstation
- Admin web is not yet a full replacement for direct env/config editing
- Tenant DB isolation is still partial: tenant-scoped platform services can route to schema/database-per-tenant targets, but the whole application is not migrated to per-tenant databases or schemas
- Native game-state proof is verified on this workstation through `SCUM.db` for representative spawn-item classes, but broader coverage across all delivery types and server environments is still incomplete
- A capture checklist now exists at [docs/assets/CAPTURE_CHECKLIST.md](./docs/assets/CAPTURE_CHECKLIST.md)

## Evidence

Source of truth for verification status:

- `artifacts/ci/verification-summary.json`
- `artifacts/ci/verification-summary.md`
- `artifacts/ci/verification-contract.json`
- `artifacts/ci/lint.log`
- `artifacts/ci/test.log`
- `artifacts/ci/doctor.log`
- `artifacts/ci/security-check.log`
- `artifacts/ci/readiness.log`
- `artifacts/ci/smoke.log`

Commands used for local verification:

```bash
npm run lint
npm run test:policy
npm test
npm run doctor
npm run security:check
npm run readiness:prod
npm run smoke:postdeploy
```

Latest local verification on this workstation completed on `2026-03-17` with all commands above passing.

Additional live runtime evidence from this workstation:

- watcher `ready` against the configured `SCUM.log`
- console-agent `ready` with successful live preflight
- one live `#Announce` command executed through the agent and observed in `SCUM.log`
- live native proof matrix captured from `SCUM.db` for:
  - `Water_05l`
  - `Weapon_M1911`
  - `Magazine_M1911`
  - `Weapon_AK47`
